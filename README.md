# LootPriority
Simple app to help calculate which players should have priority on loot in WoW Classic

## Goals (in no particular order)
1. Loot has value, not items
2. Make loot values by class more dynamic with dictionaries
3. Add a real DB instead of using a file system
4. Add a web app
5. Add tests
